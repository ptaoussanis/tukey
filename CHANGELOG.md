> This project uses [Break Versioning](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore/blob/master/BREAK-VERSIONING.md)

This is an **early-access** library that hasn't officially been published yet!

The API is still very likely to break.

Please feel free to take a look, but I wouldn't recommend any serious use yet.

Once the library is officially published, this CHANGELOG will be maintained. Until then, you can check out the commit history for recent changes.
